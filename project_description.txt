Developing ecommerce website Part 1
Develop 2 interfaces
1- An admin interface (not the django admin): 
where only users with admin access can log in and add/update/delete Categories and products

2- User interface:
Just a regular ecommerce site interface where on first page
- it shows all the categories (clothes, watches and others)
- when you click on one of categories, it would show all the products in that

     <========Part 2=========>

eCommerce enhanced
Now that you guys have created categories, product list and product detail pages, 
create add-to-cart features using sessions
